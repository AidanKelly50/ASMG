# Phase 4 Individual Contributions
## (Team ML and Software Components)

As the project comes to a close with Phase 4, it was truly amazing to see our fully finished ML models working with the software architecture to create the vision we sought for EuroTour. Our second ML model, the time series linear regression, underwent a few obstacles during the  building process. One of these obstacles was diverting from our original plan of performing a multiple linear regression with the two features of GDP and Tourism numbers, plotted against the feature of time (in years) on the x-axis. Considering we hadn’t formally learned time series regressions, immediately jumping into one with multiple features taught us to take things slow and work with what we know would be sensitive to our limited time and overall functionality of the web application. 

After some heavy consideration and attempts of the model, we narrowed down our features to just tourism numbers and time, thinking that it would be the most relevant to our National Director of Tourism persona and align the most with their goals to see how their tourist numbers are projected to increase in the future when observing current trends. Once we solidified our idea, we carried on with building it by creating functions to perform the regression, add lag columns considering the amount of years we were trying to predict into the future was three, and get the data standardized to create a flexible visualization that would work for each country.

# Progam Updates!

During the last week of the program, a lot of fun activities were planned to ensure our final week was balanced with all the work we had to do and enjoying ourselves. One of our friends on this dialogue, John, hosted a coffee-making workshop for all of us, which I really enjoyed as someone who loves coffee (thank you, John!). Additionally, we were also able to visit an escape room and compete in teams of 6 to get out within an hour, which was a really fun experience for communication, teamwork, and a great time with friends! We also visited Energyville to learn about human-centered, environmentally conscious decision-making. Afterwards, we visited C-Mine to explore an old coal mine and its new mission of focusing on creativity. As the week comes to a close, I am looking forward to the end-of-program dinner and seeing everyone’s presentations later.

I really would like to thank Dr. Fontenot and Dr. Gerber for being truly amazing instructors and mentors who made every success, challenge, and diversion from plan a valuable learning experience. They were really the driving factors of this program, from both a fun-loving and academic aspect. I would also really love to thank our program assistant, Sydney Schulz, who was an incredible person to look up to, seek out for guidance, or just a fun conversation throughout this past month. Thank you to everyone and I am so excited to bring my new skills, experiences, and friends into the fall!
