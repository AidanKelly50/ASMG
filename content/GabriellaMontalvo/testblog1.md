# About Gabriella Montalvo

![me](gabbyphoto.jpeg)

My name is Gabby and I'm from Long Island, New York. I am a rising second year studying Data Science and Marketing Analytics. I am very excited to be in Belgium for this summer and work on this project! I enjoy reading, writing, and going outdoors. Some topics I'm also passionate about are environmental sustainability, political science, ethics, and incorporating data-driven decision making into these fields. 

Some fun facts about me are that I love coffee, play five instruments, play tennis, and love writing literary criticisms and reviewing journalism in my free time. I am ready to fully explore this opportunity to contribute to this project with my amazing team!
