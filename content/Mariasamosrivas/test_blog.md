# About Maria Samos Rivas

Hi! I'm Maria Samos Rivas, a rising second-year student at Northeastern University. I was born and raised in Madrid, Spain, but I've been living in the U.S. for the past ten years—currently in Bethesda, Maryland, just outside of D.C. I have an older sister and brother who I really look up to. I'm a huge soccer fan (Hala Madrid!), and I’m passionate about using what I’m learning in Data Science and Finance to make a positive impact—especially by supporting small businesses and underserved communities. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me!
