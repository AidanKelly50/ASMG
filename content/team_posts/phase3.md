# Updates to Phase Two
While working through phase three, our group continued to develop how our user personas would interact with the app. We futher developed the researcher, who now will have a page to make research posts, a page to view the posts and a page to view trends between road saftey and tourism variables. These tourism variables includes passenger car data road quality and road density all on the country level. We also changed the ER relationship to limmit the scope of the reasearcher, include road death data and to merge all the new diagrams to the global ER diagram. This change also implies that we modified the mySQL database by adding new a new table for the RoadDeaths, for the Reseacher and the ResearchFindings. All these changes can be viewed on the phase two deliverable

# Phase II Deliverable
The main focus of this phase of the project was implement the functionality via creating the API requests and creating the ML models. 

## Features Used in ML Models
Dicuss the features used in the ML and a reasoning as to why those features were selected. Also discuss any major/surprising issues found during ML model exploration

## REST API Matri
tie back to either wireframes and/or User Stories

## Streamlit App Functionality
provide screenshots of the mocked up app and results of the implemented
functionality, including calling the ML model
