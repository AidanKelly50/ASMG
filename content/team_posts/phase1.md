# ASMG Project Introduction: Road Safety

## Project Description

Since automobiles became common in the early 1900s, automobiles have been one of the leading non-natural causes of death for humans across the developed world. Additionally, they have posed major safety and injury concerns beyond just deaths. In a world reliant on automobiles for travel, governments and independent agencies have continuously worked to make roads safer for all users, but their efforts still leave a lot of room for improvement. We are building an application to help address this problem by identifying patterns and attributes of roads across Europe that result in a larger number of accidents and fatalities. This application will consider data like car accidents, road deaths, road infrastructure spending, road quality, and road density for each country. With this information, users will be able to determine whether the roads and travel methods they plan to take are truly safe or if they should find an alternate route, and help governments determine which types of roads they should build more of to keep their citizens safe.
