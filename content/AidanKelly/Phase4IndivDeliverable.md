# Phase 4 Individual Deliverable

## Contributions

I worked across all facets of completing the project. I helped improve and analyze the ML models, edit the SQL database, write more 
API routes, create/edit Streamlit Front End for multiple pages, and write the team blog post.

## Favorite Part of the Week
My favorite part of the week was the escape room. It was a challenging and fun experience with my friends. I'm really glad we got to do it.
