# Phase 2 Individual Deliverable

## Contributions

I helped evaluate the feedback from the first week, determine the new direction we were taking our project, and write new personas.

## Interesting Part of the Week

One interesting thing that I learned over the last week is how people used to keep time before the invention of clocks. Starting in the 1300s, the bells in a central tower were used to signal every hour and half hour, using different tones for each so citizens could keep track of time. In the city of Bruges, this was the Belfort tower. In addition, the bells served as a fire alarm, as the people at the top of the tower could easily see any fires across the whole city because of the great views from the tower. In addition to keeping the time, the Belfort tower also kept safe the important documents of the city of Bruges in a chest in a fire-proof room -- something they learned to do after all of their important documents burned up in a fire.
