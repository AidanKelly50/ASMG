# Data and Software Belgium Blog - Summer 2025
Welcome to the GitHub repo behind the ASMG Blog — a site where we share insights, updates, and personal takes on the data science and machine learning work we’ve been doing as part of the Advanced Statistical Modeling Group.

## Overview
This blog started as a way for us to document our work during the ASMG course. It’s a mix of technical breakdowns, personal reflections, and project highlights — all written by the students in the EuroTour group. 

Everything on the blog is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. Each post is written in Markdown and lives in the _posts folder.
